            <h3>The Problem:</h3>
            <p>There are no suitable websites or prefabricated mediums for physician applicants to codify their Rank Order Lists when ranking their preferred specialty training programs.</p>
            <h3>The Solution:</h3>
            <p>Using the top 5 most cited factors by physician applicants (according to the NRPM 2021 survey report), a smartly designed web application is a proper, organized, accessible and efficient medium for ranking speciality training programs.</p>
            <h3>Proposal Summary:</h3>
            <p>The National Resident Matching Program (NRMP), notoriously dubbed, “The Match” is a national organization that connects doctors to programs at teaching hospitals so that they can train within a specific medical specialty. When an applicant is invited for an interview with a program, the applicant and the program both rank each other based on desirability. The respective rank lists are submitted to The Match, which uses an algorithmic approach to quite literally “match” the doctors to the programs based on corresponding positions of each other and of competing applicants and programs.
                <br />
                <br />
                This recruitment and selection process is hotly criticized in the medical community because the algorithm fails to take into account a host of factors concerning application cycles, applicants and programs–which are outside of the scope of this proposal. With an unknown number of competing applicants and programs, unknown personal preferences guiding decision-making, and only a few available positions at a given program, much of the recruitment process is out of the hands of the applicant and the program.
                <br />
                <br />
                According to the NRMP 2021 Applicant Survey Report, the average number of applications submitted by U.S. applicants amount to approximately 50, with the average number of offers granted at approximately 14.
                <br />
                <br />
                The NRMP 2021 Applicant Survey Report also asked applicants importance rating for particular attributes of a program. The top 5 most cited qualities that became deciding factors for an applicants’ rank list were as follows (in order of importance): “Desired geographic location”, “Perceived goodness of fit”, “Reputation of program”, “Quality of residents in program”, and “Work/life balance”. The ranking of these qualities were deciding factors across all specialties for every surveyed applicant in The Match. It illustrates some ability to codify and rank programs according to their desirability in the form of a prefabricated ranking system that could be embodied in an application.
                <br />
                <br />
                Applicants in The Match will likely look up individual programs on the internet, apply to them based on qualities they find most important, and rank their interviewed programs according to notes, a pros-and-cons list, sheer memory or a custom-made excel sheet. I propose that this can be made a simpler, accessible and more organized process through the use of a web application.
                <br />
                <br />
                Using the top 5 most cited qualities that were proposed as deciding factors for an applicant’s program rank list, I propose a web application that would allow applicants to sign in as users, view hospital specialty training programs, write reviews those programs for anonymous display, add programs to a personalized list, and rank those programs according to their personal perception. This would provide applicants with a clean and organized method of arranging their rank order lists and to view their own potential training programs side-by-side with graded ratings.</p>
